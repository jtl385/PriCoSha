Final Project for Introduction To Databases an NYU Tandon
By Jireh Lo

This is a social media website that allows users to create groups, invite others to their group, and share content on those groups. Users can also tag other users on content, or rate them.

These are the features, as specified by the project document:
1. Users can login
2. Users can view content items if the items is shared to the group they belong to, or if the content item is public.
3. If a another user tags you, you can accept the tag request to make it appear, or decline the tag request to delete it.
4. You can post a content item and share it with a group by clicking on the "Post a Content Item" button.
5. You can tag content items on your feed by typing in an email and pressing 'tag'.
6. You can add friends to groups you own by clicking on the "Add Friend to a Group" button.

There are no additional features.
I worked on this project alone, so I contributed to all of the work.
